---

## 🎯 EXPECTED TEST RESULTS

### **Baseline Expectations**

Based on previous API testing, we expect:

```bash
📊 PREDICTED RESULTS:
   Working Endpoints: ~80% (15-16/19 tests)
   Failed Endpoints: ~20% (3-4/19 tests)
   Success Rate: 80-85%
   Average Response Time: 200-500ms
```

### **Common Expected Failures**

1. **Content Moderation Endpoints** - May not be fully implemented
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Might return limited data
3. **Payment Management** - Could have restricted access
4. **System Health** - May require special permissions

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **If Tests Fail to Run**

```bash
# Check these common issues:
1. Internet connectivity
2. Backend server status
3. Authentication token validity
4. CORS settings for browser testing
5. API endpoint availability
```

### **If All Tests Fail**

```bash
# Potential causes:
1. Backend server is down
2. API base URL has changed
3. Authentication system changes
4. Network firewall restrictions
```

### **For Partial Failures**

```bash
# Normal behavior - expected scenarios:
1. Some endpoints may be under development
2. Certain features may require special permissions
3. Database may have limited test data
4. Some services may be temporarily unavailable
```
