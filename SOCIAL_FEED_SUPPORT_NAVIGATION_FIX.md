# Social Feed & Support Screen Navigation Fixes

## Issue

The application was experiencing navigation errors with the message "invalid value for 'component' prop" for the following screens:

- SocialFeed
- Support

## Cause

1. The SocialFeedScreen.js file was empty, causing the component reference in AppNavigator.js to be invalid.
2. There may have been issues with the SupportScreen component reference as well.

## Solution

### For SocialFeed Screen:

1. Created a new SocialFeedScreen_new.js file with the appropriate implementation for a social feed, including:

   - Posts viewing functionality
   - Like/comment interactions
   - Post creation with image upload capability
   - Filtering options

2. Updated AppNavigator.js to:
   - Import SocialFeedScreen_new instead of SocialFeedScreen
   - Update the component reference in Stack.Screen

### For Support Screen:

1. Verified the existing SupportScreen_new.js implementation
2. Confirmed that AppNavigator.js correctly references SupportScreen_new

## Components Created/Modified

### Files Created:

- d:\FYP\staykaru_frontend\src\screens\student\SocialFeedScreen_new.js

### Files Modified:

- d:\FYP\staykaru_frontend\src\navigation\AppNavigator.js

## Verification

The "invalid value for 'component' prop" errors should now be resolved for both SocialFeed and Support screens. The application should be able to navigate to these screens without issues.

## Next Steps

- Test the navigation to these screens
- Verify functionality of the social feed features
- Consider connecting the mock data to real API endpoints when backend services are ready
