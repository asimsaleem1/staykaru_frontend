_Generated: June 26, 2025_

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview

Successfully resolved all "invalid value for 'component' prop" navigation errors and completed the student module implementation with full backend integration.

## ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Navigation Component Errors - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Multiple screens had "invalid value for 'component' prop" errors:

- SocialFeedScreen (empty file)

**Solution**:

- ✅ Implemented complete SocialFeedScreen.js with social media functionality
- ✅ Updated AppNavigator.js to use correct component imports
- ✅ Fixed all missing screen registrations

### 2. AuthService Method Missing - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: `authService.getToken` is not a function

**Solution**:

- ✅ Added missing `getToken()` method to authService.js
- ✅ Updated studentApiService_new.js to use correct authService import

### 3. StudentApiService Method Missing - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: `studentApiService.getProfile` is not a function

**Solution**:

- ✅ Added `getProfile()` alias method that calls `getStudentProfile()`
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

### 4. Navigation Route Mismatches - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Dashboard navigation names didn't match registered screen names

**Solution**:

- ✅ Updated StudentDashboard_new.js navigation calls:
  - `AccommodationList` → `AccommodationsList`
